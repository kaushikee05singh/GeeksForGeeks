The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock i at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day.
Find the maximum profit that you can get.

This is my solution with all the test case passed.

// User function Template for Java
class Solution {
    public int maximumProfit(int prices[]) {
        // code here
        int res =0;
        int n =prices.length;
        for(int i =1; i<n;i++){
            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1]){
                res += (prices[i]- prices[i-1]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
