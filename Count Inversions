Given an array of integers arr[]. You have to find the Inversion Count of the array. 
Note : Inversion count is the number of pairs of elements (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j].

This is my solution for the given problem with 1110 test case passed out of 1115 as the time limit exceeded due to the use of for loop.
Trying to work on an optimized way of solving.

class Solution {
    static int inversionCount(int arr[]) {
        // Code Here
        int count=0;
        int n=arr.length;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            for(int j=i+1; j<n; j++){
                if(arr[i]>arr[j]){
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
