Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer k, find the position(0-based indexing) at which k is present in the array using binary search. 
If k doesn't exist in arr[] return -1. 

This is my solution for the given problem with all the test cases passed.

class Solution {
    public int binarysearch(int[] arr, int k) {
        // Code Here
        int low = 0 , high = arr.length-1;
        int result = -1;
        while (low <= high){
            int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
            
            if(arr[mid] == k){
            result= mid;
            high = mid - 1;
            }
            
            if(arr[mid] < k){
            low = mid+1;
            }
            
            else {
            high = mid - 1;
            }
        
    }
    return result;
    }
}
